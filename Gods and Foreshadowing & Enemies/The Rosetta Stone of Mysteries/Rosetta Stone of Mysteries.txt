A piece of writing, ancient as time.

There is also a tool, with holes, to decipher meanings.

Ignore what he's saying, this is a new idea. (Wat?)



A tool, which unveils certain words of characters that are as of yet undeciphered.


Over this stone of text, if one uses the tool, these words can be made out for one to use.

The tool, if placed in different spots, reveals different words, or perhaps different tools highlight different things by being placed in different places.
