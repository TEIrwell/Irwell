Nail your colours to the mast 
Sons of Albrythica

by silver tongues and false promises
00:16
a stigmata on our skies
00:20
atmora nor even a nord damn the
00:22
doctrines he was a fraud guldi who
00:25
tricked the grey wind and made of him a
00:26
theatrical footnote in the history of
00:29
tiber a show of false power and crooked
00:31
claim to rule i will not worship yalti
00:34
not because i cow to elven instruction
00:36
but because he is false a supposed
00:39
apotheosis of man chosen by divines who
00:41
themselves are stolen idols pale shadows
00:44


compromise god of martyr to the old world gods

this age of ash and fire demands a new one


00:56
many that we are the sons and daughters
00:58
of kind and yet i see those who say as
01:00
such prostrate themselves before her
01:02
southern imitations let me tell you of
01:04
kind the true god of the nords fierce
01:07
and dangerous widow once warrior wife of
01:10
shore who embodies the elements the
01:13
winds the rains the storms
01:16
abandon these false notions of imperial
01:18
prestige they would have you think she
01:20
is a gardener trimming nature's hedges
01:22
and breeding rabbits to accompany the
01:25
laps of women oh so noble kind is a
01:27
mother of man and beast she is the sky
01:30
itself who steals us with her icy breath
01:33
and gave us our very birth with great
01:35
exhale onto the throat of the world she
01:37
granted us our voice with which we
01:39
conquered our enemies we were a storm
01:42
which blew east west and south a
01:44
thunderous choir which shook the very
01:47
foundations of this world and built
01:49
stories worthy of eternal remembrance
01:52
our tongues were strong and right in
01:54
their message
01:56
kine is a warrior goddess of warriors
01:58


and we should revere her as such not by
02:01
tilling the soil but by nourishing it
02:03
with the blood of our enemies and when
02:05
our shedding is done and we have been
02:07
shed ourselves then kind will be the
02:09
kiss the tender lips of the Apocrypha
02:12
lift us to voidlands where we roam amongst prey and predator eternal alike
waiting for the battle at Dawn




listen to me people of skyrim abandon

the empire's gods and revive your

heritage before it is too late or soon

we will be like the other men the feeble

and weak whose skin blisters at the

touch of frost cast off headlong into

the storm and face her sacred trials

with courage lift your blades and pray

to kine we are her sons and daughters so

it is time we acted like it
