Song for the Estuary City Ablaze


Row, Once more, Brothers
Row, Once more, Brothers
Row us back across, to our home.
Through wind, sleet, snow, and pestilence
Through hail of shrapnel and test of patience
Row once more, brothers


Market dies to the fanatic who the market funded to instill regional instability interrim


A city where the foundations subsidiary construction company was exploited by the baddies to lure them in, an avenue of investigation meant as a trap to instill chaos, to ensnare victims for the first step in a new war.

'This is your reward for our love; holding up your paper gods.'

Decrees and signatures signed to formalise the drawing of a fractured kingdom.

A SeaStead off the coast divvies up new landborders, those left divide between themselves and attempt to frame themselves as fighting 'for' the people they rule over, tying cultural identity into onwards policy. Marxists cry progress, the statist and junta districts organise for duty, and mercantilist regions speak of funding the great rebound and engineering solutions through funding and mercantilism.

A Seastead, a seat of power from which it was decided.
Many of them used to exist, as means of offshore funding. Freeports and floating casinos, migrating south in Winter.
