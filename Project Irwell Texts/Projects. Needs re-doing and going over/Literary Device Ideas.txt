There's a group of people who are like SCP staff, but focus on collecting Anomalies. They study, attempt to make use of, or attempt to destroy, the anomalous materiel of this world. Think 'Ecologists' in STALKER.

Once you become anomalous, you are taken in for study.
You can also sell rare loot to them for extreme prices.

Quests - Time Crystal - Fixating ball of matter which is both crystalline but if you put something through it - yes - through it, it does not age. It remains preserved.

Powering this crystal can cause items to regenerate to a younger form- backwards entropy has been discovered. It needs POWER to break the Second Law of ThermoDynamics.
The power is off the charts, one needs the power of a fusion reactor to get it to work, and the scientists are nowhere near close.
Interestingly, though, it doesn't USE any of this power. It just requires it to be present for it to function. The power level does not diminish, but the amount required for such a large crystal is immense.

And it's only about a metre across.
