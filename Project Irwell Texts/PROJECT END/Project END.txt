Ray is home with his family, when they hear an explosion in the city, and see a bright [Void colours] or [Green for Plague] light in the distance, near where a religious building is. They are interupted, and 
The ground stops shaking, and [Ray] goes to the roof to get a better view.

More flashes of light. The ground shakes underneath them.
The sky fills with a bright [Purple? Green?] Hue, the clouds above shining like headlights in fog. A klaxon sounds, for the first time.
[Ray] gets back inside, and tunes into the news.
He looks concerned, and his family ask him what is happening.

As a city executive he receives a call to go and investigate and that there will be an inquiry later today if it is of concern.
Against the wishes of his family, [Ray] goes to check it out with the neighbourhood militia, stating it is his job to make sure the neighbourhood is protected. He will return, and though somewhat concerned he puts a smile on.

While walking to the scene, [Ray] talks with two other executives [1 & 2] and a religious figure, [3] [this city is a religious stronghold, so they are present.] 
[1] says they were interrupted in the middle of their dinner for this, and that it better be good, [2] is nervous.
[3] says this is a Bad Omen, and that the gods are still displeased at Mankind's actions, and that he wishes to perform a rite of atonement on the scene.
[1] dismisses it saying [3] should atone for the fact his supper is going cold now, and he payed good money at this fancy restaurant, etc.
[2] begins postulating the light.


[1] ["The sun does not cause lightning."] "How the hell does light come from underground though?" Dismissive, and tries to undermine/gaslight him.
[Ray] says look, he's never seen anything like it either, and that they should wait till they're down there to assess. He is interrupted mid sentence by another slight rumble under the ground.
[2] "Aftershock!"
[3] *begins chanting something in the Old Tongues.*


A gigantic hole of rubble in the ground, with steam emerging from underneath and an odour he cannot describe. [Does it smell like Plague- [Silicone & Sulphur?] or like Void- [Metallic?]] 
[Ray tells the Militia to spread out, hold people back from the site, and find a witness.]

[They] Speak to an eye-witness, trembling with burns on his hands from being too close. [Void burns are easily identifiable as they give off radiation burns. [2] would notice this and be apprehensive.]

[1] Beginning to take it more seriously as they get closer. "I don't know, or care, what this is, I want it wrapped up so I can get back."
[2] "This is serious! Forget your fucking food and your whore, and help us fix this!"
[Ray] "Enough, the both of you!"
[Ray begins co-ordinating the setting up of the perimeter]
He helps erect some barriers and his militia hold onlookers back, while he himself, a brave man, steps forwards from the cordon and observes.


The ground rumbles, very slightly at first, and then we see the surrounding area begin to shake violently and break in another earthquake.
[1] is now very shaken, and runs away in panic.
[2] and [Ray] Begin ordering people to back away, Some Militiamen flee with the civilians and some assist
Then, bright burst of light, sustained, longer than the rest.


Ray is swept off his feet, and [2], helping him up, turns to the priest, who is clutching their prayer beads, and muttering in the Old Tongue.
They dodge falling debris and [2] reaches for their PDA to declare an emergency evacuation of this area of the city. [Ray] pushes a woman from being crushed by falling bricks of a building, and tells the Militiamen to mark a pub at the end of the district as a facility for the wounded before they can be transported away. He is yelling, but it is authoratative, not angry. Most have stepped back now, save for Ray, the Militia, and a few civilians.


*The rubble turns over itself, then gives way.*
The religious building in the background begins to break apart, the cathedral spire crumbling, and the priest incredulously runs around the hole, towards the building, prayer equipment in hand, and is crushed by falling rubble.


A final ray of scorching light rises from underneath the ground, slowly at first, illuminating and shining through dirt, then the rubble ascends into the air, [and levitates, if it is void, or is catapulted at the populace if it is not] 
They hear the environment groan through the screams as the camera pans out to the sky.
Then, a sound like nothing they've ever heard before. It's the loudest thing they've ever heard. No perimeter is wide enough for this. It shatters windows for miles around, the shot, in the sky by now, highlighting this. Camera switches to very far from the street, we see civilians trampled under rubble with the glass blowing out beneath them landing and injuring people, and very unnoticeably [1] runs past.

From here, we see the start of the emergence of the Walker. Two legs sprout up, and trample a building.
Camera cuts to [1], next to the building, who is sent flying by the impact.
[Ray] picks him up and they stumble backwards. The Bulk is now emerging. [1] looks back. Still on [Ray's] Perspective, they stumble backward as it emerges, faultering, falling again, the ground quaking.

The sound plays again, it is now standing upright, casting a shadow over them, though out of view.

They are crawling away now, looking at it, crawling, then scarpering to their feet and running/limping. Camera following them, [Ray] grabs [1] again and they get into a nearby building. They get inside and exclaim, pressed to the back of the wall, 
[1] "What the fuck is that thing?!
[Ray] I don't- short conversation.
The camera moves outside, cutting them off, to the crowd. 
It is towering above them as they run, and then, it opens fire.

The Camera stays with the crowd watching them get eviscerated from the terror shadowing them, standing over them. It is on them in an instant.
[If it is Void, it is a beam of void radiation as well as levitating rocks hurled that block off the side-streets.
[if it is Plague, it unleashes a torrent of projectiles of putrifying matter that decay those it touches in a microsecond, into dust, and swiping its tentacled arms at the crowd, grabbing those funneling into side streets with great sweeps.]

We see a militiamen trying to help a woman up from the rubble, her leg broken, though, he is grabbed. The camera stays on the ground, so he goes wheeee and is not seen again.

The camera catches back up with [Ray & 1] who run out of that building as it is walking forward, the Walker trampling it with its' legs, and they run into another building [narrowly avoiding one of the tentacles?]


In the restaurant they run into, we see projectiles rain down into the building, it can sense they are in there and it shoots those closest to the door. 1 is hit and Ray feels his body evaporate in his arm, 1 screamed for a microsecond, and then, nothing.

Ray runs into the back, into the kitchen, and finds a family huddled in there crying and praying, and one man trying to open the fridge door, removing shelves that had fallen down in the way, half the kitchen is on fire and the fire alarm beeping loudly.

Through the back-door we see more people getting cleansed, and [Ray] [frantically and hands shaking grabs his pistol or a fireaxe and smacks/shoots the door hinges, then they collectively pry it out] and wait underneath until the walker has passed, in the dark, huddled, hearing the screams and the fire alarm.

The child is crying and muttering under their breath. [Are we still alive? change the line.]
The fire alarm and screams fade out.


He has a hushed conversation with the religious stranger, and he theorises and cites an old text.
[Lore]

He believes it is a religious phenomena, the prophesised second reckoning, 
yet[Ray] is too concerned on his family to comment.
He leaves them, and heads home.



[Ray] arrives home, and sees his family still there, surprisingly. The screens in the house are playing a government issue warning for a "threat of unknown origin." The TV says "shelter in place, until you are reached."
Everyone else in the flats are panicking and leaving and his wife is visibly shaken.
She is stood at the door with a kitchen knife in hand, and is relieved when she sees him.
She asks him what happened, and he demands they grab what provisions they can, grab their go-bag, and run. "But the TV said"
"No, we're Running."
The kids are visibly frightened.
"To where?" she asks,
He grabs his sidearm, and grabs the go-bag she hands to him.
She asks "What about the Baron, the Militias, the Army? Are they doing anything about... whatever this is?"
He opens the door, and urges them to get outside. They follow him, semi-distrustful but judging from his demeanour that it must be serious.


They flee down the stairs along with others, and go outside and begin moving.
"To where?"
They are going to a designated shelter, and from there, out of the city. There has to be a way out of here.

towards the bus. The militiamen are already organising people to get onboard.

They walk past triage,
