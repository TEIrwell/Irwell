"You make me nostalgaic for times where I didn't hate being alive"

Miss the Moorland Mists
Night In on the Hills




Remembering you
[How you used to be]?

Fix the shit between us two
[Free]?



Nerve Damage since th' sixties war
Working man can't fight no more
Always gets the shut door
Deplorably treated,

Once done with his tour
Enshrined in law
The poor man fighting for

Dermatitis
Skin Makes me weep out of every pore
She seeps out of every pore
Pandora Acid Tier Cradle of gore

Stuxnet








how much i love me english grub and hate farty mcdonalds burgers overpromising but underdelivering in size and the amount of gherkins they SHOULD have on it

meat and gravy and wrapped in pastry,

i'm 'avin it

No room for your itty bitty patty nappy snack scran
Calorie Defecit

flavours in the secret sauces of the provinces
Flavours roll over like the 

Worcershire Sauce slathered on the bonnet of this wee
baked packet of butter soaked batter and fish
