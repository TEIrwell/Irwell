[Start slow]

Like a moth to a light I was drawn to you,
For years we called, killing time, it's old news.
Like ripples in waves we seperated,
Only to come back and start new antics.

You're one in a million, 
behind A hundred bloke lo-ho-ng queue.. [beat change]
Oh, What the fuck should I do?
Another dagger for you to choose,
leaving me to stew.

Into the dark, or else under the light.

[Main Pt. 2]

In time I thought I'd have you,
It's hard to say this off-the-cuff

I place my hopes upon you,
I wish they'd only be enough.

On common ground, the things we'd do,
You move my heart from love to lust.

You leave me turning on the screw.
Your flaunting always leaves me bust.

[segue]
[chorus]

[Main Pt. 3]

I didn't mean to steal your light,
But I can't wish this shit away

To me, you've nowt left that you'll say,
So in the dark these words must stay,

You can't say it doesn't matter,
Apathy won't change a thing.

Am I just another wanker?
Just your puppet on some string.


I tore out my heart, but it still stings. [Rise in pitch like Go with the Flow]



Vermillion drips in bliss, while I still wait on for you.


[Hook]

Oh, like a moth to a lamp
In time I thought I'd have you

Oh, like a moth to a lamp
For a long time I've watched you

Oh, my Darling
I place hopes upon you.


You have made this oh-so-tough.


I feel so deceived.

[Stinging]
I wait for the change, but 
I'm still sat here thinking.

You've nothing left to say.
