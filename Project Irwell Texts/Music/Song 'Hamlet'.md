-Hamlet-
Themes: Impetus. Driven and yet don't take the first step. Always talking, never doing. Want to change, never do. Ouroborus

*START THE SONG WITH A SAMPLE OF FAYE VALENTINE SAYING
"I'LL ALWAYS BE HERE CHEERING FOR YOU.*

"I want to start anew
to escape from the mem'ries of-a-life-I-once-knew" (*say it quick*)


*Beat starts off like Crumpledbigskin or Leech Boy?*

I feel (*like?*) I create
An ouroborus
of homemade (*change with self-inflicted?*) MISERIES,
Stemming from the lack of impetus in ME

It reaches out, to those I hold close
Impotent, and driven by promises I break to myself.


"For if not, I will surely die"
Put pipe dreams before what's right in front of ME
*That's why she left me, a future I envisioned but couldn't make as I had nothing tangible.*
(After all,? At the end of the day? Ultimately?) The future I planned (for us?) was nout but a DAY-DREAM


*Chorus*
A new day dawns, as do new-found burdens
I wake up, I whinge, do nothing, and drop, the curtain       *So much for time signatures lol*
As I'm too disheartened to fucking bother,
This day's ended, here comes... another.

I'm becoming a constant BURDEN
I thought I'd be the bigger PERSON
Nout I want comes to fruition,
Exeunt. Hamlet.




*Verse II*
Beat changes, to one reminiscent of Leech Boy
-You wouldn't even call her, you ignored her, you were distant. Include this.-
-False Hope-

Something's rotting in place the of what we once called our friendship,
O Woe Is I, who buries it all with a quip,
Put on a smile, ring you up, and say I'll be there for you,
With a house, a car, and some more dreams that I'll acrue
You took all that I gave you,
but I didn't give owt to you back,
But (my) pipe dreams and wishful,
 dreams on which I nagged
On and on, 
consistently
(in an) attempt(ing) to keep you near,
(From Four-thousand miles away,
and yet, your mind was clear.                                     - NO IT WASN'T IT WAS HARD FOR HER- )
Oh I tried to key you in,
and tell you of my new grand designs,
But There's no method in the madness, 
contorted, and blind,
To the reality of life over a few texts and a call,
Even after every night your heart would pour,
How I miss and wait for you was different, you said,
from how the wait feels, for you, on the other end,
(I understand the lack of impetus for you to even try,
When every single night, all we could do was cry)
See eachother in our dreams and say that we still care,
Until all our emotions are leeched and stripped bare,
Spend some time watching some shows, 
hope the call doesn't freeze or lag,
Go to bed, go to work, and fixate on fucking plans,
No, I wouldn't let you escape my, delusions for fear,
That one day that you'd leave me, but O Hamlet,
How, that time drew ever-near
Oh no, I don't blame you, for in my dreams I hid.
An outcome of disappointment and withdrawal.




*Put an Idiom here for christ sakes*

"I warn you now"

I've thought of you, every day since,
And of my own ineptitude. 
Of how, I wouldn't call you,
nor be there, when you need.

I can only imagine how you must now feel, 
You had to move on, of that now, I see
There's no shame in doing so and so please ignore my pleas
I was distant, false-hopeful, and I lacked all clarity.


"I warn you now"
I've though of you, every day since, and (of me) own ineptitude,
Oh if only Neptune could wash away my false platitude
And give me the chance to say it all over again
And give myself a more dignified end.


I'm becoming a constant BURDEN
I thought I'd be the bigger PERSON
This is not what I had intended
Exeunt. Hamlet.
