Autumn has come,
I Rush to school through the leaves,
Dogs barking on early nights in,
You arrival is a different picture
Eagerly awaited over scorched days of deep Blue

Autumn has come,
Sowed seeds linger behind closed curtains,
A look inside, through a different lens,
Plans forecast dampened by the long night's rain
