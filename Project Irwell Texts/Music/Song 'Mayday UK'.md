(Dont rip off Meydei so much)

Hey look here, do you feel the benefit?
With your benefits-cheats and your ad-nauseum Rwanda Scheme?
Claiming you're delivering for the people who didn't vote you in.
Do ye hear, come near, hear us jeer,
My revolution may be choking on austerity measures,
but the tide will come back again, and I still fly the red flag here, here, here.
