I do nothing with my time
I spend it waiting for something to happen again,
for my life to start again

i dread my future, wherein i believe I'll find a different dull job to continue to exist for the sake of it

i wore a hole in my insole, and through the sole of my shoe, pushing trolleys, and cleaning.

beans.
chips.


grease stains on the floor and an oven that's black and brown with grease, a Sisyphean task, to ask me to clean what needs replacing, because it'll never be clean if it's that baked into the metal. it needs a fucking angle grinder and an orbital sander.

and all this for £1.44 an hour, £46 a day, so I can afford to get a car and a cheap house and maybe just maybe work for the rest of my life in a rented piece of shit somewhere that's not here"
