With the conflict approaching rapidly to our East, what it comes down to is the ebb and flow of Russian Expansionism. I see a pattern in the geopolitical view of Russian doctrine;  every time their state shrinks, they want to expand outwards to ensure prosperity spreads outwards. To stalin, that meant to expanding to incorporate all former territories he could lay claim to and build upwards in power from there, for Putin, it's just capital. He is owed a deck of cards in Geopolitical favour, so he accepts them, and moves them forwards. Deployments are as important as the words said in Vienna.

We see this acting out in 2022, as the year opened with North Korean missile tests, Russian demands that the United States not move or act in any way to 'jepoardise a peace' between them as they talk about nuclear de-escalation.

All while Biden, existed... he spoke softly to some protestors and threatened to use Taiwan as a new front, this would most likely come in the form of militarising it further, given South China sea politics. 

God knows how that went.

All while Putin moves in the Ukraine and encouraged Belarus to wage a threat of Hybrid-warfare on Poland and Lithuania's borders
