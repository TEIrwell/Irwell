Idea I:
The Scientists and the Religious types are working together, as the old tomes did not speak of what to do to those who survived after the Nuclear War. They aim to reach heaven on earth in the apocalypse.

Idea II: The Scientists are working with the Technocrats, to create a new collected human consciousness to monitor over the country, acting as a human supercomputer.


Either way, the Pagan roamers would be unhappy with this.
