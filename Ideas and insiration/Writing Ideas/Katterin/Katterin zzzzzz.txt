Katterin is another protagonist, almost in scale of Tig, who becomes a "Pandora" figure, unleashing the apocalypse, either at the same time as, just before, or after Tig's final arc. 
She is cold, calculated, driven by curiosity and believes in prophecy.

What drives her? Is it knowledge or vengeance? Does she want to change the prophecy? This could be a good thought process.
She used to be kind, but this world has turned her cold. She now thinks only of herself perhaps.

Model her on Yenneffer maybe.

She was tortured, it has left her with a scar on her neck and scars over her eye, and a nose slightly out of alignment, but she is still a beautiful woman in her late twenties, older than Tig. She was a child in Bleak Sun. Perhaps that's her and her mum staring at the bleak sun?
Her first prophecy occurred the night of the apocalypse.
Her mum and her were taken in by druids, and she was taught by them.








She speaks out to Tig before they even meet, before she is introduced in the Game.
