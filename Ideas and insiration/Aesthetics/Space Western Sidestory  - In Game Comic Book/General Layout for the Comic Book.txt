The Comic Book will serve as an allegory for the use of power, and the moral dilemma that comes with it, as our noble hero Space Cowboy Badass with... funky space cowboy badass armour will be pictured shooting his way out of every scenario, but over time we see the cowboy turn from saving good ole folk to murdering people by a code of honour and eventually murdering hundreds while happy go lucky digital comic book music plays, as if it's cool and fun that he's mudering people for a lost cause.


The people in the world comment that the writing "fell off" and that it started strong but over time the character just becomes an action hero with no depth.

NO METAPHOR HERE.

Teehee.

You also get a cool blaster if you commit enough war crimes in a sidequest, if this was a Bethesda RPG.
